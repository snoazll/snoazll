### About
I don't actively develop software. I used to work as a freelancer for video game developers, now I'm mostly interested in Linguistics & Cognitive Science. 

This page serves as a small personal archive and allows me to organise things.

#### Fiction
[Clementi](https://github.com/snoazll/Clementi), a science-fiction book set in a dark fantasy universe that I self-published for free back in 2016 - available only in Turkish.

[Åžeytani: Xinmao](https://github.com/snoazll/Seytani), a dark fantasy novella with a violent setting that I published in 2021 - Turkish version. Will convert to markdown.
