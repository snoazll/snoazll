### About
I don't actively develop software. I used to work as a freelancer for video game developers, now I'm mostly interested in Linguistics & Cognitive Science. 

This page serves as a small personal archive and allows me to organise things.

#### Fiction
[Clementi](https://github.com/snoazll/Clementi), a science-fiction novel set in a dark fantasy universe that I published in 2016.

[Åžeytani](https://github.com/snoazll/Seytani), a dark fantasy story split into four novellas. Xinmao, the first part, was published in 2021.
